# FrndFndr

FrndFndr is web application that helps connect users with their future furry (or scaly) best friend!

I was eager to develop this tool with the goal in mind that every animal should find a loving home.  If you have talked to anyone whose adopted, you know that it's just as much about saving an animal as it is growing your family by (at least) one.  

# Features
- Use FrndFndr as a guest or saved user
